# Odd Duck Products

---
*created by: Dustin Apodaca*

* Odd Duck Products was created as a lab that demonstrates where Odd Duck wanted me to build an app that displays three potential products side-by-side-by-side, without favoring any single product. As a rule, I needed to manage the size and the aspect ratio of the images.

* As the app's purpose is to have the staff members choose which product, of the three displayed images, that they would be most interested in seeing as a new creation, I needed to store each anonymous vote, calculate totals, and visually display the results.

* To keep the product selection process as untainted as possible, I was instructed to not allow any results to be shown to users until there is a total of 25 selections made.

* The marketing team was not only interested in the total number of clicks, but also the percentage of times that an item was clicked when it was shown. So, I also needed to keep track of how many times each image was displayed and do the calculations.
